Glyph uses [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) to process natural language prompts. The content of any
message you prompt Glyph with (starts with @Glyph or is sent in a DM) will be anonymously sent to Dialogflow for the
sole purpose of understanding and responding to your request. Logging at the Dialogflow has been disabled for your
further privacy.

You **must** opt in to allow your message content to be sent to Dialogflow before using natural language prompts.
