Hi!
I'm %s, 
an [open source](https://github.com/yttrian/glyph.kt/) Discord bot created by %s.

I use machine learning to process natural language requests you
give to me to the best of my current trained ability.

To see what I can do, be sure to check out my 
[skills](https://gl.yttr.org/skills)
and suggest new ones you'd like to see, in the
[official server](https://discord.gg/Meet9mF) 
or via the anonymous feedback skill.
